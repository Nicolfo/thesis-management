## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
We were pretty close to our estimated time, the only difference was due to some research for new features

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

**Positive:**
1) We improved a lot our time estimation skills
2) Scrum meetings were more precise and target-oriented
3) We learned how to work optimally with branches and how to merge them properly

**Negative:**
1) Add better test user management in order to make the presentation smoother
2) Streamline the test development process so that they keep working after each merge/task implementation

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve?
  - We were able to merge branches more frequently, avoiding big conflicts and spending less time on them
  - We were less optimistic with our time estimation: the estimated time was pretty close to the actual one

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - We were able to achieve all our other improvement goals.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Being more efficient in our planning process
  - Improve the test development process
  - Add better test user management for the demo presentation

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
- We constantly improved as a team since the beginning of the project, both as a team and as individuals; in this sprint, most of things went according to plan, indicating that we now have a better understanding of how to organize our work and complete it.
