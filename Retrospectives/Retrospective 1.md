RETROSPECTIVE Sprint 1 (Team 4)
=====================================

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed vs. done: 8 committed, 8 done
- Total points committed vs. done: 23 points committed, 23 points done
- Nr of hours planned vs. spent (as a team): 122h 30m planned, 129h 30m spent

**Remember** a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
Our Definition Of Done:
- Most Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?
We underestimated how long it would take to finish the various tasks, especially the code review, merging all our branches took a lot longer than expected. We also didn't consider the individual skills when performing the time estimation.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

**Positive:**
1) Having another point of view about a certain problem can help reducing time spent solving it.
2) Cooperation was essential and very successful, especially for bug fixing and reduced time spent on each task.
3) We did more scrum meetings (one every three days) and it was useful for better communication.
4) Despite having little time to do everything, we were able to complete all the stories working together as a team under pressure.

**Negative:**
1) We need to merge all our branches more often, so we can solve some conflicts in a simpler way.
2) We can improve the way we perform scrum meetings.
3) Our time estimation was too optimistic; we planned to complete too many stories in a single sprint, so a lot of our activites were rushed.

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  - We were able to perform scrum meetings regularly.
  - We created tasks dedicated to tests only.
  - We defined most of the application's API before starting development.
  - We were more careful about balancing the skills of team members working together on a story.
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?
  - Most of the APIs were well-defined at the beginning, but we missed some of them: we should be more careful about it next time. 
  - We were able to achieve all our other improvement goals.

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)
  - Perform more frequent branch merges to avoid big merging conflicts at the end.
  - We will be less optimistic with our time estimation for the tasks, keeping a time buffer in case of issues.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  - Despite being under pressure and with very limited time, we were able to work hard together to resolve all the issues and prepare the presentation on time; we worked very efficiently and this allowed us to complete many stories.
